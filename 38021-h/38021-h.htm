<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Didier (1943, 1954) has described the bacula of several Old World
microtines, and other rodents. Argyropulo studied (1933a, 1933b) five
species of Cricetinae and <i>Microtus socialis</i>. Ognev (1950)
illustrated numerous species of Eurasian microtines. Hamilton (1946)
figured and described the baculum of 11 species of North American
microtines. Hibbard and Rinker (1942, 1943) figured the baculum of
<i>Synaptomys cooperi paludis</i> and of <i>Microtus ochrogaster
taylori</i>. Dearden (1958) studied the baculum in two Asiatic species of
<i>Lagurus</i>, in six subspecies of <i>Lagurus curtatus</i> of North
America, and in six other species of microtines of other genera.</p>

<p>The baculum can be preserved easily with standard study skins, and is
potentially useful in interpreting relationships on any taxonomic level,
and especially in determining the relationships of species within a
genus, if used together with other structures.</p>

<p>The anatomical orientation of the baculum needs comment because some
confusion exists in the literature, especially concerning the use of the
terms ventral and dorsal. The urethra lies on the anatomically ventral
side of the penis, and of the baculum. In the center of the penis lies a
single corpus cavernosum penis, shown in cross section proximal to the
baculum in Figure 1c. Dorsally an artery, thinner walled than the ventral
urethra, ends in a somewhat reticulate sinus surrounding primarily the
middle part of the baculum within the bulbous glans penis. The corpus
cavernosum penis (the structure has no median septum, at least distally)
terminates with the baculum and is closely knit to it. The site of this
bond is evident in the tuberosities and sculpturing of the base of the
baculum.</p>

<p>The part of the penis enclosing the baculum, when not erect, is folded
back as shown in Figures 1a and 1b. As a result the anatomically ventral
surface faces upwards, or at least posterodorsally. The use of the term
ventral in this account refers to the anatomically ventral side, that is
to say to the side of the baculum facing the urethra.</p>

<p>The baculum in microtines consists of an elongate stalk, having a
laterally, and to a lesser extent dorsoventrally, expanded base and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg
184]</a></span>

an attenuate distal shaft. Usually, three digitate processes of
cartilaginous material in which additional ossifications may occur arise
from the terminus of the shaft. The proportions and curvature of the
stalk vary as do the proportions of the terminal ossifications to each
other and to the stalk. In some species one or more of the digital
processes are frequently completely unossified.</p>

<p>Preserved specimens of <i>Microtus arvalis</i>, <i>Microtus
agrestis</i>, <i>Microtus orcadensis</i>, <i>Microtus nivalis</i>,
<i>Microtus guentheri</i>, <i>Microtus subterraneus</i>, <i>Clethrionomys
glareolus</i>, and <i>Ellobius lutescens</i> were provided by Prof.
Robert Matthey of Lausanne, Switzerland. J. Knox Jones, Jr. carefully
saved the bacula with specimens of <i>Microtus fortis</i> and
<i>Clethrionomys rufocanus</i> from Korea. Dr. W. B. Quay, Department of
Zoology, University of California, supplied specimens of <i>Synaptomys
cooperi</i>, <i>Phenacomys intermedius</i>, and <i>Microtus oregoni</i>.
Dr. Franklin Sturges and Mr. John W. Goertz, Museum of Natural History,
Oregon State College, Corvallis, have provided specimens including bacula
of <i>Clethrionomys occidentalis</i>, <i>Microtus oregoni</i>, and
<i>Microtus townsendii</i>. Dr. Randolph L. Peterson and Mr. Bristol
Foster, Royal Ontario Museum of Zoology, Toronto, Canada, provided
specimens of <i>Phenacomys intermedius</i>. Dr. J. N. Layne, University
of Florida, Gainsville, Florida, presented me with a baculum of
<i>Microtus parvulus</i>.</p>

<p>I am indebted to all of these persons for their aid, and to various
collectors for the Museum of Natural History, who preserved bacula with
specimens. Many of these specimens were obtained through the assistance
of the University of Kansas Endowment Association and the National
Science Foundation.</p>


<h2>METHODS</h2>

<p>Bacula were obtained from fresh specimens, specimens preserved in
alcohol or formalin, and dried study skins. The processing of bacula has
been discussed by Hamilton (1946), Friley (1947), White (1951), and
Dearden (1958). The methods used to preserve bacula for my study differed
some from any of those reported. The terminal part of each penis
including the baculum imbedded in the glans penis was removed in its
entirety and placed in a vial. The catalogue number was kept with each
specimen at all times. A two per cent solution of potassium hydroxide was
added. All specimens were examined at least once a day. If tissues other
than the glans penis were present they were removed with forceps when
softened usually at the end of one day. Several drops of Alizarin red-S
stain in a saturated alcoholic solution were added to the 3 to 5 ccs. of
KOH solution in each vial. Solutions were replaced if they became turbid
enough to obstruct observation of the clearing penis. After one day the
solution containing stain was removed and replaced with two per cent KOH
solution without stain. When the glans became sufficiently cleared that
the stained baculum could be seen easily, the solution was replaced by
glycerin in which clearing was completed. The time required for the
entire process varied from one day to more than two weeks depending on
the size of the specimen and on its condition. Fresh specimens clear more
rapidly than dried specimens, and those that are dried more rapidly than
those that are preserved. A three or four per cent solution of hydroxide
will hasten the process, but more frequent observation is required to
prevent excessive maceration.</p>

<p>Specimens were then examined in a shallow dish containing glycerin
under a binocular microscope. The baculum can be viewed from any desired
direction. The method described above leaves the baculum intact within
the glans penis; therefore its orientation can be determined relative to
the thick walled urethra and the thin walled dorsal artery that extends
onto the dorsal side of the baculum. The ventral curvature of the penis
proximal to the baculum, and the distal extension, characteristic of most
species, of the dorsal border of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg
186]</a></span>

the glans (both shown in Figure 1) are other features aiding in correctly
orienting cleared specimens. The digitate processes are not so often
injured, lost, or displaced when the method described above is used as
they are when the penis is dissected. Specimens were stored in glycerin
in glass shell vials having polyethylene stoppers. A small card bearing
the name, number, locality, and other data was placed in each vial. A
specimen thus enclosed can be kept indefinitely, or removed and mounted
in balsam as described by White (1951:631) or in plastic as described by
Dearden (1958:541) and thus stored in the vial containing the skull of
the specimen.</p>

<p>Drawings were made on millimeter ruled paper while the baculum was
viewed under a binocular microscope with a square ruled eyepiece.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted all specimens listed are in the University of
Kansas Museum of Natural History. Catalogue numbers are cited.
Measurements are accurate to within less than one-tenth of a millimeter.
Proportions as stated in the text are approximations, accurate to within
one-twelfth (8.33 per cent). The range of variation is unknown for some
species. Mention is made if maturity is known or suspected to differ in
specimens being compared.</p>

<p>The development of the baculum has been studied by Callery (1951) in
<i>Mesocricetus auratus</i> and by Ruth (1934) in the laboratory rat. In
the rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) the bone is of endoblastemal origin
being laid down by a condensation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.
At the distal end of the bone dense fibrous tissue is then differentiated
and at the proximal end hyaline cartilage. Growth is by substitution at
the proximal end and by subperiosteal lamellation circumferentially. A
marrow cavity is formed by resorption. In the baculum of the hamster the
primary center of ossification is in the stalk, and is present at the age
of three days; the secondary centers are in lateral processes and are
present at 80 days and enlarge subsequently. A tertiary center, in each
median process, may or may not develop later. Maximum development of the
baculum is reached late in the reproductive life of the hamster.</p>

<p>The early ossification of the baculum noted in the rat and the hamster
occurs in <i>Microtus</i> also. A specimen of <i>Microtus montanus
fusus</i> (76831, from 5 mi. N, 26 mi. W Saguache, 9600 ft., Saguache
County, Colorado) only 74 mm. in total length and weighing only 6.6
grams, had a slender ossified baculum having enlarged ends. This vole was
one-half of the average length and less than one-fifth of the average
weight of an adult, and of approximately the size at which weaning takes
place.</p>

<p>The development of the baculum in <i>Microtus ochrogaster</i> was
studied in 32 specimens of various ages. The specimens (between Nos.
74994 and 75074) were collected between August 15 and September 4, 1957,
at localities on the Great Plains. These specimens were from breeding
populations, as evidenced by pregnancy of females and by large size of
testes of males. The length and width of the stalk of the baculum, the
presence of digital ossifications, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg
187]</a></span>

total length of the animal, and the size of the testes were noted.
Variability in length of testes is greatest when voles are from 140 to
150 mm. in total length. Sexual maturity is reached rather abruptly when
the total length of most individuals is 140 to 150 millimeters. If the
baculum likewise underwent more rapid growth at the onset of sexual
maturity, greater variability should be evident in the length of the
baculum of voles 140 to 150 mm. in total length than in bacula of voles
of other sizes. This was the case (see Figure 1d). The baculum does not,
however, suddenly reach its maximum maturity.</p>

<p>The primary ossification is in the stalk. The secondary ossification
is in the median process except in <i>Lagurus</i> (Dearden, 1958:551) and
some individuals of <i>Neofiber</i> (see account on page 258). Tertiary
centers of ossification are in the lateral processes. The primary
ossification is present at an early age and subsequently increases in
size and solidity. The secondary and tertiary ossifications are
progressively more common in older voles. The increase in degree of
ossification of all parts continues after sexual maturity is reached.
Individual variation and variation with age in the baculum of <i>Microtus
pennsylvanicus</i> have been illustrated by Hamilton (1946:380). Figures
14, 15, and 17 illustrate variation with size, which is correlated with
age, and also illustrate individual variation. The three bacula are from
adult voles having testes that measured 15, 16 and 16 mm. in length,
respectively. Each vole was trapped in late June. The total lengths in
millimeters of the three voles are 172, 167, and 181; weights are 55,
52.4, and 65.5 grams. I judge that the greater size of the stalk and the
better developed base shown in Figure 17 than in Figure 15 are
illustrative of age variation; the difference in the size of the lateral
digitate processes is, in this case, attributable to individual
variation. Differences in the distal end of the baculum in Figures 42 and
43, show individual variation also. Figures 35 and 36 represent two
different subspecies; different individuals of <i>M. mexicanus
mogollonensis</i>, however, exhibit individual variation of the same
degree.</p>

<p>Hall and Cockrum (1953) list 44 species of microtines in North
America. At least twelve of these are insular or local forms perhaps
derived from some other species; for example <i>Microtus coronarius</i>,
an insular form derived from <i>Microtus longicaudus</i>; <i>Microtus
provectus</i>, considered by Chamberlain (1954:587) and by Wheeler
(1956:176) as a subspecies of <i>Microtus pennsylvanicus</i>; and
<i>Microtus ludovicianus</i>, a close relative of <i>Microtus
ochrogaster</i>.</p>

<p>All North American genera have been studied. Of the genus
<i>Microtus</i> in North America, all subgenera but <i>Orthriomys</i> and
all species but the following nine, have been studied: <i>M. (Orthriomys)
umbrosus</i>, the insular <i>M. (Stenocranius) abbreviatus</i>, <i>M.
(Microtus) breweri</i>, <i>M. (Microtus) nesophilus</i>, <i>M.</i></p>

<h2>ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES</h2>

<h3>Dicrostonyx groenlandicus (Traill)</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 3 and 4</p>

<p>Baculum: stalk elongate, greatest length (3.1 mm.) 2 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> to 2&frac12;
times greatest breadth, and 4&frac12; times greatest depth; digitate
processes usually cartilaginous, occasionally lateral processes partly
ossified; basal tuberosities weakly to moderately developed, medially
confluent; posterior profile in dorsal view rounded with rounded
posterior apex or shallow notch; dorsal concavity in end-view shallower
and not so wide as ventral concavity; median constriction approximately
<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> greatest depth; ventral part of base in end-view wider than dorsal
part; shaft straight or slightly curved; base of stalk placed dorsally
relative to axis of shaft; stalk spatulate, sometimes with distal
enlargement; at mid-point stalk wider than high; lateral profile in
dorsal view sloping gradually without abrupt curvature anterior to point
of greatest width.</p>

<p>The baculum of <i>Dicrostonyx torquatus</i> figured by Ognev
(1948:476) agrees with that of <i>D. groenlandicus</i> in shape of stalk,
and in lateral digitate processes that are small relative to size of
median process; but differs in more elongate, terminally enlarged, bulbar
shape of median process. None of my specimens showed ossification in the
lateral processes, observed by Hamilton (1946:381) in <i>Dicrostonyx
rubricatus richardsoni</i> [ = <i>D. groenlandicus richardsoni</i>]. In
all of my specimens the cartilaginous median process was larger than that
figured by Hamilton, or by Dearden (1958:542).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Four from; Point Barrow, Alaska, 52524
(Barrow Village), 67264 (died in captivity); Brooks Range, Alaska, 50536
(Wahoo Lake, 69&deg;08', 146&deg;58'), 50539 (Porcupine Lake, 68&deg;51'57",
146&deg;29'50", 3140 ft.).</p>


<h3>Lemmus trimucronatus (Richardson)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 2</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk heavy, broad, greatest length (2.8 mm.) in mature
individuals (Fig. 2) as little as 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times
greatest breadth, greatest length no less than 2<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times greatest depth
of base; three ossified processes, median one from as long as to &frac12;
longer than the lateral processes, and approximately
<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> wider and twice as deep as lateral processes;
length of median process almost 3&frac12; times its breadth,
approximately &frac12; length of stalk; basal fossae broadly confluent;
posterior profile in dorsal view evenly rounded; in end-view ventral
concavity deeper than dorsal concavity, constriction as little as
&frac12; greatest depth in mature specimens; shaft straight, bluntly
rounded, or slightly decurved and laterally inflated terminally; lateral
profile in dorsal view a gradual slope from widest point of stalk
anteriorly onto shaft; in younger individuals stalk slenderer, otherwise
as described above.</p>

<p>Five specimens examined by me differ from one figured and described by
Hamilton (1946:379) in that stalk is better developed, larger relative to
size of processes, length of stalk in my specimen (Fig. 2) 2.8 as opposed
to 2.1 mm. in Hamilton's specimen; median process shorter, 1.5 as opposed
to 1.8 mm., proximal end rounded rather than concave, not partially
enclosing tip of shaft; proportion of and relative sizes of median and
lateral processes approximately same as in Hamilton's <i>Lemmus
helvolus</i> [= <i>Lemmus trimucronatus helvolus</i>].

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg
194]</a></span>

A specimen figured by Dearden (1958:542) has a basally trilobed median
process.</p>

<p>The baculum of the Asiatic <i>Lemmus lemmus</i> figured by Ognev
(1948:413) agrees with my specimens in the ossification of three
processes, the relative sizes of these processes to each other and to the
stalk, the well-developed base of the stalk and heavy bluntly rounded
shaft; the baculum of <i>Lemmus lemmus</i> differs in greater
anterolateral extent of basal tuberosities, in proximal notch seemingly
separating these tuberosities, and in median process being slenderer.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Five, of two subspecies; <i>Lemmus
trimucronatus alascensis</i>, Point Barrow, Alaska, numbers 50591, 50678,
50731, 50758; <i>Lemmus trimucronatus subarcticus</i>, Wahoo Lake,
69&deg;08', 146&deg;58', 2350 ft., Brooks Range, Alaska, 50948.</p>


<h3>Synaptomys cooperi Baird</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 5 and 6</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk elongate, greatest length (2.7 to 2.8 mm.) 2
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> to 2&frac12; times greatest breadth, 4 to 5
times greatest depth; three processes ossified or lateral processes
unossified, ossifications relatively small (in 78380, median ossification
less than &frac14; as large as lateral ossifications although median
cartilaginous process is larger), length of median process
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> of length of
stalk, cartilaginous part of median process larger; posterior profile in
dorsal view convex throughout or bilobate; tuberosities moderately
developed, deflected dorsal to axis of shaft; in end-view medial
construction <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub> greatest depth of tuberosities;
shaft tapered from point of greatest width, slightly inflated
terminally.</p>

<p>The specimen (KU 13716) figured by Hibbard and Rinker (1942:29) has
been restudied. It was first cleared and stained to soften the dry
cartilage binding the digital processes together and to differentiate
bone and cartilage. The lateral processes are small and cartilaginous
(Fig. 6) and seem intact. The differences between this specimen and
others examined by Hamilton (1946:381), Dearden (1958:542), and myself,
namely the relatively larger median ossification, the absence of
ossification in lateral processes, and the distinctly bilobate base and
larger size, may represent geographic differences, or individual
variation. The proportions of length, width, and depth of the stalk, and
the appearance in lateral view do not differ greatly from others examined
by Hamilton, by Dearden (1958:546), and by me.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Five, representing four subspecies; <i>S.
cooperi gossii</i>, 6 mi. N Midway, Holt Co., Nebraska 78379, 78380;
<i>S. cooperi relictus</i>, 5 mi. N, 2 mi. W Parks, Dundy Co., Nebraska,
72601 (immature); <i>S. cooperi saturatus</i>, 3 mi. S Demotte, Jasper
Co., Indiana, 3-C-454, collection of W. B. Quay; <i>S. cooperi
paludis</i>, Meade County State Park, Kansas, 13716.</p>


<h3>Clethrionomys rutilus Pallas</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 11</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk elongate, and proximally enlarged, greatest length (2.7
mm.) 2 times greatest breadth; less than 4 times greatest depth; three
well-developed ossified processes; length of stalk 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times length of median process; median process
with basal (and ventral) protuberence and lateral lobes, arched in
dorsoventral plane; lateral processes as large as median process,
flattened distally, having ventromedial vane on distal half; basal
tuberosities of stalk well developed, medially confluent; posterior
profile in dorsal view trilobate or convex

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg
195]</a></span>

throughout with rounded posterior apex; dorsal concavity well developed,
ventral surface but slightly concave, medial constriction of base as
little as &frac12; greatest depth; shaft straight, slender, at mid-point
of stalk but slightly wider than high; basal tuberosities largely dorsal
to axis of shaft in lateral view; lateral profile in dorsal view with an
abrupt curvature separating the gently sloping sides of the shaft from
the basal part at its greatest breadth.</p>

<p>The specimen of <i>Clethrionomys rutilus</i> figured by Ognev
(1950:120) is essentially like the North American specimens examined by
me in the relative sizes of the ossifications and the general shape of
the stalk.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Four, of one subspecies; <i>C. r.
dawsoni</i>, west bank Gakona River, 1700 ft., 5 mi. NNE Gulkana, Alaska,
42865, 42866; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 2400 ft., Yukon Territory, 42910,
42921.</p>


<h3>Clethrionomys gapperi (Vigors)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 10</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk elongate, greatest length (2.8 mm.) 1&frac34; times
greatest breadth, and 3&frac34; times greatest depth; proximally
enlarged, greatest depth &frac12; greatest breadth; three well-developed
ossified processes; length of stalk 2 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times
length of median process; median process arched in dorsoventral plane,
with basiventral protuberence or spine and lateral lobes; lateral
processes as large as median process, flattened distally, arched; basal
tuberosities of stalk well developed, medially confluent; posterior
profile in dorsal view trilobate or convex throughout with a rounded
posterior apex; dorsal concavity well developed, ventral surface but
slightly concave, or in some cases slightly convex; medial constriction
of base <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub> greatest depth; shaft straight,
slender, at mid-point of stalk twice as wide as high; basal tuberosities
dorsally placed relative to axis of shaft; lateral profile in dorsal view
abruptly curved anterior to point of greatest width; slender stalk
distinct from angular enlarged base.</p>

<p>The most noticeable difference between the baculum of <i>C.
rutilus</i> and <i>C. gapperi</i> is size. The proportions of the four
ossifications are approximately the same. Ventral vanes on the lateral
processes are not developed in <i>C. gapperi</i>. <i>C. gapperi</i> and
<i>C. rutilus</i> are more nearly alike in their bacula than any other
two species of <i>Clethrionomys</i> examined. <i>Clethrionomys
occidentalis</i>, the other New World species, is also much like <i>C.
gapperi</i> and <i>C. rutilus</i>. The differences are of a magnitude
comparable to those between the bacula in subspecies of <i>Microtus
montanus</i> (Figs. 19-21) for example, or in subspecies of <i>Lagurus
curtatus</i> (Dearden, 1958:542).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Nine, of two subspecies; <i>Clethrionomys
gapperi athabascae</i>, British Columbia, 42922 (Indian Creek, Mile Post
234 of Alaskan Highway), 64281 (West bank Racing River, 89 mi. W Muskwa),
64287 (North bank Tetsa River, 56 mi. W, 11 mi. S Muskwa), 64290 (44 mi.
W, 9 mi. S Muskwa), 64310 (32 mi. W, 2 mi. S Muskwa); <i>Clethrionomys
gapperi galei</i>, 31 mi. N Pinedale, Sublette Co., Wyoming, 42108; Grand
Mesa, Delta Co., Colorado, 60014 and 60015 (5&frac12; mi. E, 12 mi. S
Collbran), 60022 (8 mi. E, 1/2 mi. S Skyway).</p>


<h3>Clethrionomys occidentalis (Merriam)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 12</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk elongate, greatest length (2.8 mm.) 2&frac12; times
greatest breadth, 6 times greatest depth; three well-developed ossified
processes; median process larger than lateral processes, &frac12; the
length of stalk, curved, basally

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg
196]</a></span>

broad, ventrally keeled, trilobate posteriorly; lateral ossifications
large, flattened distally, curved; posterior profile of stalk posteriorly
slightly emarginate, thus bilobate in outline; in end-view dorsal
concavity deeper than ventral, constriction less than &frac12; greatest
depth, tuberosities confluent, visible in dorsal view at each side; shaft
slender, especially in depth, straight; at mid-point of stalk almost
twice as wide as deep, slight terminal inflation.</p>

<p>The general proportions of the stalk and the relatively large,
uniquely shaped processes, are characteristic of most specimens of the
genus <i>Clethrionomys</i> examined.</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>: <i>C. occidentalis californicus</i>, one
from Mary's Peak, Benton Co., Oregon, 30, F. W. Sturges' collection.</p>


<h3>Clethrionomys glareolus Schreber</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 13</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk elongate, greatest length (2.9 mm.) twice the greatest
breadth in the specimen examined, flattened proximally, greatest length
almost 6 times greatest depth of base; three well-developed ossified
processes; median process arched in a dorsoventral plane, with basal
notch and lateral lobes; lateral processes as long as median process,
bowed in dorsal view, flattened distally, with ventromedial vane; basal
tuberosities of stalk weakly developed, medially confluent; posterior
profile in dorsal view evenly rounded; in end-view dorsal concavity
shallow in comparison to most species but deeper than ventral concavity,
constriction &frac34; greatest depth; shaft straight, at mid-point
slightly wider than high, elongate, widest point of stalk less than
&frac14; of total length from proximal end, slight lateral inflation at
tip; lateral profile in dorsal view sloping at first abruptly and then
gradually from widest point of stalk anteriorly onto shaft.</p>

<p>The specimen of <i>Clethrionomys glareolus</i> figured by Ognev
(1950:31) in dorsal view as I interpret it, resembles my specimen in the
rounded base; in the elongate, distally inflated shaft; in the initially
abrupt slope of the lateral profile in dorsal view from the greatest
width of stalk anteriorly; and in the presence of three well ossified
processes. Ognev's specimen differs from mine in the median process being
more elongate relative to its width, and rounded proximally, lacking
lateral lobes and basal notch; in lateral processes being less curved; in
the greater terminal inflation of the shaft; and in the closer
approximation of the terminal processes to the shaft. The baculum of
<i>Clethrionomys glareolus</i> as described and figured by Didier
(1954:243-244) resembles my specimen in general proportions, but is more
pointed proximally and more curved in dorsoventral plane. Didier states
that the baculum is rather variable in form in this species, in different
regions, but that a large number of specimens must be examined to assess
the geographic nature of this variation.</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>: One from Zermatt, Valais, Switzerland,
67100.</p>


<h3>Clethrionomys rufocanus Sundevall</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 9</p>

<p>Baculum: Base of stalk broad but relatively flattened dorsoventrally,
greatest length (3.2 mm.) less than 1&frac12; greatest width, 4 times
greatest depth; three well-developed ossified processes; median process
arched in dorsoventral plane, having basal notch and lateral lobes;
lateral processes as long as median process,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg
197]</a></span>

flattened distally, with ventromedial vane; basal tuberosities of stalk
weakly developed, medially confluent; posterior profile in dorsal view
convex with rounded posterior apex; dorsal surface of base almost flat,
ventral concavity broad and shallow; constriction &frac34; greatest depth
(not including an unusual irregularity on the ventral surface of the
base); shaft straight, at mid-point of stalk distinctly wider than high,
slender at distal end, widest point of stalk almost
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of total length from proximal end, tip of shaft
rounded; lateral profile in dorsal view gradually sloping from widest
point anteriorly onto shaft.</p>

<p>The specimen of <i>Clethrionomys rufocanus</i> figured by Ognev
(1950:97) resembles my specimen in the presence of three well ossified
processes. Ognev's specimen differs however in the lack of a proximal
notch on the median process, the lesser proportion of the stalk included
in the basal enlargement, the more posterior position of the point of
greatest width, and the presence of a concavity in the posterior profile
of the stalk in dorsal view. These differences in the stalk may be owing
to a difference in age (my specimen perhaps being older).</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>: One from 1 mi. NW Oho-ri, 6 M., Korea,

<h3>Phenacomys intermedius Merriam</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 7 and 8</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk slender, greatest length (2.9 mm.) 2&frac14; to
2&frac12; times greatest breadth, 4 times greatest depth; three
well-developed ossified processes, median one almost &frac12; length of
stalk, curved, broad basally and slightly larger in all dimensions than
either lateral process; lateral processes flattened distally, curved;
base of stalk well developed, basal tuberosities medially confluent or
separated by medial emargination, posterolateral faces flattened or
rough; emarginations in the four adults examined; posterior profile in
dorsal view bluntly pointed or flattened except for emargination
posterially, abruptly curved at point of greatest width; shaft arising
broadly from distal side of base of stalk; in end-view hour-glass shaped,
medial constriction pronounced, both dorsal and ventral concavities deep;
shaft having relatively straight but distally convergent sides; at
mid-point of stalk, 1 to 1&frac12; times as wide as deep; tip bluntly
rounded, or slightly inflated.</p>

<p>The specimens from Quebec differ from the one from Wyoming in smaller
size, relatively smaller lateral digital processes, larger more medial
basal emargination, and slender shafts. The baculum of <i>Phenacomys
intermedius</i> differs much from that of <i>Phenacomys longicaudus</i>,
described by Hamilton (1946:381) and by Dearden (1958:547). Dearden
states that the three bacula examined by him of <i>Phenacomys
longicaudus</i> differ markedly from the specimen described by Hamilton.
It seems to me that in major features the resemblance is greater between
the specimens of <i>Phenacomys longicaudus</i> examined by these two
authors than between their specimens and specimens of other microtines,
including <i>Phenacomys intermedius</i>. Neither Hamilton nor Dearden
record the exact localities of capture, the collections in which the
specimens are deposited, or the catalogue numbers of specimens.
Consequently verification of identifications and observations is
difficult.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Five, of two subspecies; <i>P. intermedius
intermedius</i>, 5.4 mi. S Moran, Teton Co., Wyoming, 3-C-309, collection
of W. B. Quay; <i>P. intermedius celatus</i>, four (including one
immature specimen) from Authiernord,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg

Abitibi-ouest Co., Quebec, specimens in collection of Bristol Foster
designated by numbers 2041-2044 of S. Anderson's field catalogue. Smith
and Foster (1957:107) were of the view that <i>Phenacomys ungava</i>
(including the above specimens from Quebec) may be specifically distinct
from <i>Phenacomys intermedius</i>.</p>


<h3>Ondatra zibethicus (Linnaeus)</h3>
<p class="center">Not figured</p>

<p>Baculum: In the single specimen examined, less mature than that
figured by Hamilton (1946:384), the digitate processes are cartilaginous,
the basal tuberosities are less well developed, and the shaft is
slenderer throughout. The cartilaginous processes are of the same
proportions as ossified processes in the figure mentioned. The shaft is
also convex ventrally in lateral profile. The view of the side here
considered to be anatomically the ventral side (adjacent to the urethra)
is labelled dorsal view in Hamilton's specimen.</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>: One, from Reserve, Brown Co., Kansas, 72405.</p>


<h3>Microtus (Herpetomys) guatemalensis Merriam</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 42 and 43</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk moderately elongate, greatest length (3.5 mm.)
2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times greatest breadth, spatulate, flattened
throughout, greatest thickness <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> millimeter;
three ossified processes; median process having three cornered base,
curved dorsally, wider than high, &frac14; to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub>
greatest length of stalk; each lateral process bent at middle, as long as
median process, compressed laterally; base of stalk curved dorsally,
tuberosities marginal, hence narrow, lateral excavations of tuberous
margin not confluent medially; in end-view ventral concavity broad, no
dorsal concavity, medial constriction but slightly less than greatest
thickness (not depth); shaft wider than high throughout, at mid-point
more than 3 times as wide as high; tip of shaft slightly inflated both
laterally and dorsoventrally; lateral profile gradually sloping
anteriorly from widest point of stalk.</p>

<p>Specimen number 65921 (Fig. 43) differs from number 65895 (Fig. 42)
described above. Terminus of shaft of number 65921 has lateral lobes from
which arise lateral cartilaginous processes; median terminal ossification
irregular in shape, smaller, imbedded in terminally bilobate cartilage.
In the spatulate flattened stalk these two specimens are much alike. An
immature specimen, number 65908, is smaller (length of stalk 2.6 mm.)
also flattened and spatulate, has the terminal processes cartilaginous,
the lateral processes bent medially, and proportions as in the adult.</p>

<p>The baculum shows no noteworthy resemblance to that of any other
species of North American <i>Microtus</i>; on the other hand the
differences between <i>M. guatemalensis</i> and some other species are no
greater than the differences between certain species included in the
subgenus <i>Microtus</i>. The baculum neither strengthens nor weakens the
case for subgeneric rank for <i>M. (Herpetomys) guatemalensis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Three from Guatemala; 65895 (2 mi. S San
Juan Ixcoy), 65908, (3-1/2 mi. SW San Juan Ixcoy), 65921 (10 mi. E, 4 mi.
S Totonicap&aacute;n).</p>

<h3>Microtus (Arvicola) richardsoni (DeKay)</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 38 and 39</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk broad, greatest length (3.7 to 4.3 mm.) 1&frac12; times
greatest breadth, relatively flattened, greatest depth
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> greatest breadth; single median ossified
process, in smaller of two specimens this ossification incomplete and of
unusual shape (Fig. 39); length of stalk 4 times length of median
process; concavities of basal tuberosities medially confluent,
constriction less than &frac12; greatest depth; widest point of shaft
less than &frac14; length of shaft from posteriormost point; shaft wider
than high except at distal end that is inflated dorsally and sometimes
laterally; both ventral and dorsal concavities of base of stalk broad and
moderately deep; posterior profile in dorsal view evenly rounded or
having marginal notch.</p>

<p>In the absence of ossified lateral processes my two specimens differ
from bacula of <i>Microtus (Arvicola) terrestris</i> figured by Didier
(1943:79, 1954:245, 247, 248) and by Ognev (1950:591). The median process
relative to the size of the shaft is smaller, and the shaft relative to
its length is wider in <i>M. richardsoni</i> than in <i>M.
terrestris</i>. The stalk of <i>M. (Arvicola) amphibius</i> figured by
Didier is like that of <i>M. richardsoni</i> in its greater breadth and
median notch on posterior border.</p>

<p>The relationship of the New World water rat, <i>M. richardsoni</i>, to
the Old World water rats (genus <i>Arvicola</i> of some European authors)
is uncertain. Miller (1896:66) placed all of them in the subgenus
<i>Arvicola</i>. Subsequent authors, stressing differences in the teeth,
have placed <i>M. richardsoni</i> in the subgenus <i>Aulacomys</i> of
Rhoads. Zimmerman (1955) has shown that teeth in some <i>Arvicola</i>
approach the more complex pattern of <i>M. richardsoni</i>. He argues
also that <i>Arvicola</i> is generically distinct from <i>Microtus</i> on
the grounds that the two groups have separate origins, <i>Arvicola</i>
having descended from the genus <i>Mimomys</i> and <i>Microtus</i> from
some other group of microtines. This argument also was advanced by Hinton
(1926:47-48). Pending further studies of the possible polyphyletic origin
of other subgenera of the genus <i>Microtus</i>, I refer both <i>M.
richardsoni</i> and <i>M. terrestris</i> to the subgenus <i>Arvicola</i>.</p>

<p>The evidence afforded by the bacula available is not conclusive as to
relations of Old World and New World water rats. No general agreement on
the number of species in this Palaearctic group has been reached, and
bacula of only three or four of the numerous Old World subspecies have
been figured. I have examined none.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Two, from Wyoming; 42454 (31 mi. N
Pinedale, 8025 ft., Sublette Co.), 37903 (23-1/2 mi. S, 5 mi. W Lander,
8600 ft., Fremont Co.).</p>


<h3>Microtus (Chilotus) oregoni (Bachman)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 45</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk broad, greatest length (2.2 mm.) 1&frac34; times
greatest breadth, 3&frac12; times greatest depth; three well-developed
ossified processes; median process <sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub> length of
stalk, rounded or tapered terminally, proximal end opposed to tip of
stalk and flattened obliquely; lateral processes
<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> length of median process, deeper than wide,
curved; tuberosities of stalk well developed, confluent medially, visible
in dorsal view; in end-view dorsal concavity narrow, moderately

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg
200]</a></span>

deep, rounded, ventral concavity wide, deep, flattened; base wider
ventrally than dorsally; shaft tapering more or less uniformly,
terminally inflated.</p>

<p>In the relative sizes, to each other and to the stalk, of the three
digitate ossifications <i>M. oregoni</i> resembles closely the Old World
representative of the same subgenus, <i>M. (Chilotus) socialis</i>, as
figured by Argyropulo (1933b:181). In <i>M. oregoni</i> the greatest
width of the baculum is more proximal on the stalk than in the <i>M.
socialis</i> figured by Argyropulo but closely resembles the baculum of
the <i>M. socialis</i> figured by Didier (1954:242). In possessing a
shallow emargination in the base of the stalk and in possessing a median
process that is smaller than the lateral processes, <i>M. socialis</i>,
as figured by Didier, differs from <i>M. oregoni</i>. The baculum figured
by Argyropulo (<i>loc. cit.</i>) of <i>Sumeriomys colchicus
schidlovskii</i> [ = <i>Microtus (Chilotus) socialis schidlovskii</i>
according to Ognev, 1950:392] differs from other <i>Chilotus</i> that
have been studied in having an unusually elongate median process and a
more distal placement of the widest part of the stalk.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Three, of the subspecies <i>M. oregoni
oregoni</i>, from 5 mi. N Orick, Humboldt Co., California, 3-C-248,
collection of W. B. Quay; from Mary's Peak, Benton Co., Oregon, 66,
collection of F. W. Sturges; and from Sec. 3, T. 11S, R. 5W, Benton Co.,
Oregon, 79183.</p>


<h3>Microtus (Stenocranius) gregalis (Pallas)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 34</p>

<p>Baculum: Length of stalk (2.4 mm.) 1&frac34;, times greatest breadth,
4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times greatest depth; median ossified process
well developed, more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> length of stalk,
higher than wide, slightly bowed, closely appressed to terminus of shaft;
basal tuberosities of stalk moderately developed, confluent medially,
posterior profile of medial apex rounded in dorsal view, lateral
indentations present, hence trilobate outline; in proximal end-view base
wider ventrally, ventral concavity broader than dorsal concavity but of
equal depth, medial constriction <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> greatest
depth; shaft slender in distal part, inflated terminally, and wider than
high at mid-point of stalk; lateral profile a smooth slope of gradually
decreasing curvature from point of greatest width to near distal end.</p>

<p>The baculum of this species figured by Ognev (1950:461) differs in
having lateral ossified processes, and a more rounded base of the stalk.
Resemblance to the New World <i>Stenocranius</i> is discussed below.</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>: One from "Eastern Europe," 8059.</p>


<h3>Microtus (Stenocranius) miurus Osgood</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 32 and 33</p>

<p>Baculum: Length of stalk (2.8 mm.) 1&frac12; times greatest breadth,
3&frac12; times greatest depth; median process ossified,
<sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub> to <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub> length of stalk,
laterally compressed, sometimes arched in dorsoventral plane; lateral
processes cartilaginous, slender; basal tuberosities well developed,
averaging less enlarged than shown in Figure 32, but more angular in
lateral outline than shown in Figure 33; tuberosities confluent
posteriorly; posterior profile smoothly rounded to trilobate, curvature
at point of greatest breadth usually acute; in proximal end-view base
wider dorsally, deep dorsal concavity, shallow ventral concavity, medial
constriction <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub> of greatest depth; shaft slender
anteriorly, at mid-point of stalk

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg
201]</a></span>

twice as wide as high, at tip higher than wide, laterally inflated;
lateral profile in most specimens abruptly curved anterior to point of
greatest breadth.</p>

<p>The single specimen of the Old World <i>M. (Stenocranius) gregalis</i>
examined resembles the New World <i>M. (Stenocranius) miurus</i> in the
angular lateral profile at the point of greatest breadth of the stalk,
slender shaft in comparison to broad base of stalk, and presence of a
single well-developed laterally compressed median process. The base of
the stalk in the baculum of <i>M. gregalis</i> is less well developed and
smaller than in the baculum of <i>M. miurus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Nine, all of the subspecies <i>Microtus
miurus muriei</i>, from the Brooks Range, Alaska; 51077 (Lake Schrader,
145&deg;09'50", 69&deg;24'28", 2900 ft., Romanzof Mts.); 51151, 51152,
51154, 51164, 51166, 51169 (last 6 from Wahoo Lake, 69&deg;08',
146&deg;58', 2350 ft.); 51210, 51213 (last 2 from Porcupine Lake,
68&deg;51'57", 146&deg;29'50", 3140 ft.).</p>


<h3>Microtus (Chionomys) nivalis Martins</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 47</p>

<p>Baculum: Greatest length of stalk (2.7 mm.) 2&frac14; times greatest
breadth, 4&frac12; times greatest depth; three digitate processes,
lateral processes mostly cartilaginous in single adult examined; median
process well ossified, approximately <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> length of
stalk, basally notched, not arched, laterally compressed distally; base
of stalk broad and flat, basal tuberosities well developed, separate;
posterior profile in dorsal view rounded, convex except for medial notch
separating tuberosities; dorsal and ventral concavities deep, broad,
equal; medial constriction less than &frac12; greatest depth; in dorsal
view shaft tapering gradually from widest point, terminally rounded; at
mid-point of stalk almost twice as wide as high.</p>

<p>In the elongate, largely cartilaginous lateral processes of the
baculum, the specimen described above resembles <i>M. longicaudus</i>.
The size of the median process in comparison to the size of the stalk is
also the same. The lateral processes have larger ossifications and the
base of the stalk is more robust in <i>M. longicaudus</i> than in <i>M.
nivalis</i>.</p>

<p>The well ossified lateral processes and enlarged base of Didier's
(1954:240) specimen suggest that it is of a more mature individual than
the one described above. These specimens of <i>M. nivalis</i>, as well as
the specimens of <i>M. longicaudus</i>, exhibit dorso-ventral flattening
of the mid-part of the base of the stalk.</p>

<p>The baculum of a specimen from Switzerland is weakly developed, of
small size (shaft 2.0 mm. in length), slender, thin, spatulate, and
terminally inflated. Digital processes were not observed, perhaps owing
to excessive maceration in preparation. The general appearance of the
baculum is that of an immature individual, although the animal was not
small (165 mm. total length in preservative).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Two <i>Microtus nivalis nivalis</i>;
Zermatt, Valais, Switzerland, 67105; Wetterstein, Germany, 65127.</p>


<h3>Microtus (Chionomys) longicaudus (Merriam)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 48</p>

<p>Baculum: Base of stalk well developed, greatest length (3 mm.)
1&frac34; times greatest breadth, 3<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times
greatest depth; three ossified processes; base of median process rounded;
median process slightly curved in dorsoventral plane, in length almost
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> greatest length of stalk; ossifications in
lateral processes

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg
202]</a></span>

variable in size, frequently widely separated from shaft by cartilage,
rarely as large as median ossification; basal tuberosities usually
well-developed, medially confluent; profile of base in dorsal view
trilobate or irregularly convex throughout; constriction &frac12;
greatest depth; shaft relatively straight or slightly bowed ventrally or
dorsally, shaft at mid-point of stalk wider than high; tip of shaft
laterally inflated; widest point of stalk approximately &frac14; length
of stalk from proximal end; lateral profile in dorsal view tapers
gradually onto shaft anteriorly from point of greatest width of stalk;
shaft variable, from slender terminally and nearly parallel sided (Fig.
48), to broad distally and tapered.</p>

<p>In many of the features that distinguish <i>M. longicaudus</i> (and
the closely related insular species <i>M. coronarius</i>) from other
North American <i>Microtus</i>, <i>longicaudus</i> resembles the Old
World species of the subgenus <i>Chionomys</i> (that is to say, <i>M.
nivalis</i>, <i>M. gud</i>, and <i>M. roberti</i>). These features are
medium size, long tail, grayish color, montane habitat, relatively short
molar tooth-row, moderate sized and unconstricted incisive foramen,
relatively decurved upper incisors, elongate nasals, relatively broad
interorbital region without well-developed median ridge, and similar
chromosomes (Matthey, 1955:178). For these reasons I am here referring
<i>Microtus longicaudus</i> to the subgenus <i>Chionomys</i>; previously
it has not been referred to that subgenus.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Six, of three subspecies; <i>Microtus
longicaudus littoralis</i>, Sullivan Island, Alaska, 42972, 42969; <i>M.
l. mordax</i>, 3/4 mi. N, 2 mi. W Allenspark, 8400 ft., Boulder Co.,
Colorado, 50335, 76829; <i>M. l. sierrae</i>, Crane Flat, Mariposa Co.,
California, 50252, 50253.</p>


<h3>Microtus arvalis (Pallas)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 22</p>

<p>Baculum: In the single specimen examined, stalk small, greatest length
(2.3 mm.) 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times greatest width, almost 6 times
greatest depth, flattened proximally; three well-developed digitate
processes, the median one ossified, the lateral processes cartilaginous;
median ossification laterally compressed and decurved at tip, bilobate at
base; basal tuberosities of stalk weakly developed, medially confluent;
posterior profile in dorsal view evenly rounded; ventral concavity deeper
and narrower than dorsal concavity, but both comparatively shallow;
medial constriction <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> greatest depth; shaft
straight, at mid-point twice as wide as deep; lateral profile tapering
from greatest width gradually to parallel sides of distal third of
stalk.</p>

<p>From the baculum of <i>Microtus arvalis</i> figured by Ognev
(1950:173), and from the baculum figured by Didier (1954:238) my specimen
differs in the absence of lateral ossifications in the digitate
processes, smaller and slenderer median ossification, and weaker base.
These differences in part may be owing to a difference in age, my
specimen being the less mature.</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>: One from Vidy, Switzerland, 67101.</p>


<h3>Microtus orcadensis Millais</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 24</p>

<p>Baculum: In the one specimen examined, stalk broad, greatest length
(2.6 mm.) 1&frac12; times greatest breadth, 3&frac12; times greatest
depth; three digitate processes ossified; median process relatively
broad, in length more than &frac12; length of stalk, triangular in dorsal
view, with small spurs posterolaterally,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg
203]</a></span>

middorsal ridge posteriorly; lateral ossifications slightly curved,
slenderer, less than &frac12; depth and less than &frac12; transverse
thickness of median process; basal tuberosities well-developed, confluent
medially; in end-view base wider dorsally than ventrally, dorsal
concavity broader and more abruptly curved at mid-point than ventral
concavity; constriction &frac12; greatest depth; posterior profile in
dorsal view notched, setting off a posterior shelf; stalk including shaft
wider than deep throughout, at mid-point width twice depth; lateral
profile abruptly curved anterior to point of greatest width, sides of
shaft tapering gradually anteriorly to rounded uninflated tip.</p>

<p>The baculum of this insular species, placed in the "<i>arvalis</i>"
group by Ellerman (1941:595), resembles the baculum of both <i>Microtus
agrestis</i> and <i>Microtus guentheri</i> more than it resembles the
baculum of <i>Microtus arvalis</i>. Similarities in the chromosomes of
<i>M. arvalis</i> and <i>M. orcadensis</i> were noted by Matthey
(1953:254, 279), who was of the opinion that <i>M. orcadensis</i> is an
insular derivative of the <i>arvalis</i>-group.</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>: One from the Orkney Islands, 67106.</p>


<h3>Microtus guentheri Danford and Alston</h3>

<p>Baculum: In the one specimen examined, stalk broad, greatest length
(2.9 mm.) 1&frac12; times greatest breadth, 3&frac12; times greatest
depth; three digitate processes ossified; median process slightly less
than &frac12; length of stalk, broad, dorsally curved; curved lateral
ossifications shorter and more slender than median ossification; basal
tuberosities well developed, angular, confluent across posterior border
of projecting shelf; in end-view tuberosities projecting ventrolaterally
from central shelf; dorsal surface at medial constriction flat, ventral
surface broadly and deeply concave; posterior profile in dorsal view
trilobate, central lobe formed by posteriorly flattened shelf, surface of
attachment visible only on lateral lobes; at mid-point stalk almost twice
as wide as deep, depth of shaft greater than width proximal to inflated
terminus.</p>

slender, smaller than median ossification; posterior profile of stalk in
dorsal view trilobate, basal tuberosities well developed, confluent
medially; in end-view dorsal concavity broader and deeper than ventral
concavity; medial constriction pronounced (less than &frac12; greatest

<h3>Microtus montanus (Peale)</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 19, 20 and 21</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk broad, greatest length (varying with subspecies from
2.3 to 3.1 mm.) 1&frac12; to 1&frac34; times greatest breadth,
3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> to 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times greatest
depth; three ossified processes, median one largest, more than twice as

<h3>Microtus oeconomus (Pallas)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 44</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk broad and flattened, greatest length (3.5 mm.)
1<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> to 2 times greatest width, 4 to 5&frac12;
times greatest depth; three ossified processes, median one largest,

some specimens, widened at base; attachment of processes to shaft
displaced ventrally; base of stalk widened, posterior profile in dorsal
view usually trilobate, in a few cases rounded, median lobe forming
posterior shelf, lateral lobes dorsally raised and forming margins of
lateral tuberosities; in end-view thickness frequently more or less

<p>The baculum of <i>M. oeconomus</i> (Old World) figured by Ognev
(1950:257) resembles but exceeds that of <i>M. oeconomus</i> (New World)
in the relatively large median process and slender lateral processes, but
differs noticeably in the presence of a deep median notch in the base of
the stalk. A specimen from Hungary is intermediate between Ognev's
specimen and those from the New World in both size of median process and
size of lateral processes, and has an unnotched base resembling that in
Figure 44.</p>

<h3>Microtus mexicanus (Saussure)</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 35 and 36</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk attenuate, greatest breadth relatively near proximal
end; greatest length (3.1 to 3.4 mm.) more or less twice greatest
breadth, 4 to 5 times greatest depth; usually a single process ossified;
lateral processes relatively small, cartilaginous or (in three specimens,
63094, 69453, 68019) with small ossifications; median process relatively
small, sometimes appressed to tip of shaft, in length less than &frac14;
length of stalk; posterior profile in dorsal view rounded, flattened
posteriorly, or in some specimens trilobate with angular edges; in
end-view relative depths of dorsal and ventral concavities variable,
dorsal usually deeper than ventral; distal end of stalk frequently bowed
dorsally; shaft slender distally, sometimes slightly inflated terminally,
or (in one specimen, 63085) near tip small lateral projections that are
perhaps fused lateral ossifications; lateral profile in dorsal view a
gradual slope anteriorly from point of greatest width to slender tip.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Thirteen, of four subspecies; <i>Microtus
mexicanus mexicanus</i>, Las Vigas, Veracruz, 30692; Nevada de Toluca,

<h3>Microtus californicus (Peale)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 37</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk elongate, greatest length (3.0 mm.)
2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times greatest breadth, 4&frac12; times
greatest depth; median process ossified, &frac14; length of stalk,
basally broadened, flattened and shallowly grooved ventrally to fit tip
of shaft, to which the process is closely appressed; lateral processes
cartilaginous; ends

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg

of stalk bowed upwardly; posterior profile of base of stalk rounded or
slightly trilobate if posterolateral concavities form in tuberosities;
moderate development of tuberosities, in end-view dorsal concavity
slightly deeper and narrower than ventral concavity, both comparatively
shallow, median constriction <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> greatest depth;
shaft curved, more or less terete at mid-point of stalk, terminally
inflated dorsally; lateral profile in dorsal view gradually curved from
point of greatest width anteriorly onto shaft.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Two, of two subspecies; <i>Microtus
californicus californicus</i>, 1 mi. NE Berkeley, in Contra Costa Co.,
California, 76828; <i>Microtus californicus mohavensis</i>, &frac12; mi.
SE Victorville, San Bernardino Co., California, 63745.</p>


<h3>Microtus pennsylvanicus (Ord)</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 14, 15, 16 and 17</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk heavy, broad, greatest length (2.2 to 3.0 mm.)
1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> to 1<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times greatest
breadth, up to 3&frac34; times greatest depth; three ossified processes,
median one largest, usually not twice so deep as lateral ossifications;
median process usually distinctly widened basally, in length
approximately &frac12; length of stalk; base broad, frequently angular
laterally and basally, sometimes bilobate; basal tuberosities well
developed, medially confluent; in end-view more or less uniformly
biconvex or ventral surface more flattened than dorsal surface, medial
constriction &frac12; to <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> greatest depth; shaft
relatively heavy, at mid-point stalk almost twice as wide as deep and
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> as wide as base of stalk; shaft terminally
rounded and sometimes slightly inflated; lateral profile in dorsal view
abruptly or gradually curved anterior to point of greatest width and then
gradually curved anteriorly.</p>

<p>Specimens examined averaged slightly smaller and were more variable
than those described by Hamilton (1946:382). The greater variation may be
in part geographic, as five subspecies are represented. Lateral processes
are the last to ossify. One specimen (75082) with well-ossified median
process lacks any lateral ossification. Four bacula of <i>M.
pennsylvanicus</i> (locality not specified) studied by Dearden (1958:547)
agree in general with the description above.</p>

<p>One specimen shows a break, perhaps resulting from injury, in the
shaft (Fig. 14). One specimen has a posteromedian spine on the median
digital ossification (Fig. 16). Comparison with <i>M. agrestis</i> is
included with the description of <i>M. agrestis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Thirteen, of six subspecies; <i>Microtus
pennsylvanicus alcorni</i>, 20 mi. NE Anchorage, Alaska, 43043;
<i>Microtus pennsylvanicus finitus</i>, Laird, Yuma Co., Colorado, 68544;
<i>Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus</i>, 5 mi. N, 26 mi. W Saguache, 9500

<h3>Microtus agrestis (Linnaeus)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 18</p>

<p>Baculum: Greatest length of stalk (2.9 mm.) twice greatest breadth,
4&frac12; times greatest depth; stalk well developed, shaft not flattened
dorsoventrally; large median ossified process, minute lateral
ossifications in single specimen

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg
207]</a></span>

examined; length of stalk 2&frac12; times length of median ossification
which is higher than wide, slightly decurved, sagittate in dorsal view,
with three-cornered base; basal tuberosities of stalk moderately well
developed, medially joined; posterior profile in dorsal view evenly
rounded; ventral concavity broader than, but of comparable depth to,
dorsal concavity in end-view, base of stalk wider ventrally, constriction
&frac34; greatest depth; at mid-point of stalk shaft is but slightly
wider than high; pronounced terminal inflation of shaft; lateral profile
in dorsal view sloping abruptly from widest point of stalk anteriorly
onto stalk which then tapers more gradually to terminal inflation.</p>

<p>From the baculum of its New World counterpart, namely <i>Microtus
pennsylvanicus</i>, my specimen of <i>Microtus agrestis</i> and the
specimen figured by Didier (1954:239) differ in their minute lateral
processes, relatively larger median processes, and more elongate, less
dorsoventrally flattened shafts.</p>

<p>The specimen of <i>M. agrestis</i> figured by Ognev (1950:320), in
dorsal view has lateral concavities producing a somewhat trilobate
outline in the base of the stalk, and the lateral processes are well
developed; the median process is larger and bulbous, wider distally than
proximally. Without larger numbers of bacula of <i>M. agrestis</i> I am
unable to reconcile these differences. The differences between <i>M.
agrestis</i> and <i>M. pennsylvanicus</i> seem comparable to the
differences between some other species of <i>Microtus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>: One, from Gryon, Switzerland, 67102.</p>


<h3>Microtus (Pedomys) ochrogaster (Wagner)</h3>

1<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> to 2 times greatest breadth, 2&frac12; to 4
times greatest depth; median process ossified, relatively small, less
than <sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub> length of stalk; lateral processes
arising from subterminal part of stalk, cartilaginous or with small
ossifications; posterior profile in dorsal view broadly rounded or
slightly angular, widest point of stalk <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> to
&frac14; the length of stalk from base; basal tuberosities well developed
and medially confluent, in end-view dorsally convex, or at least less
deeply concave than ventrally; shaft straight, base bent ventrally or
more commonly dorsally; at mid-point of stalk wider than high, often
twice as wide as high; viewed from above, lateral profile from point of
greatest breadth to middle of shaft a gradual sigmoid curve; slight
terminal inflation of shaft.</p>

<h3>Microtus (Pitymys) pinetorum (LeConte)</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 27 and 28</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk broad, greatest length (2.5 to 2.7 mm.)
1<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times greatest breadth, 4 times greatest
depth; median process ossified, size small, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub>
length of stalk, higher than wide, having small anterodorsal prominence
in both specimens examined; lateral processes cartilaginous, relatively

broadly rounded, or having blunt median apex, convex throughout; basal
tuberosities moderately well developed, medially confluent, barely
visible in dorsal view when mature; in end-view median constriction
<sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> greatest depth, ventral concavity deeper than
dorsal concavity, both comparatively shallow; stalk at mid-point
1&frac12; times as wide as deep; shaft relatively slender, bowed dorsally
at tip, relatively straight otherwise; lateral profile in dorsal view a
gradual concave slope from point of greatest width anteriorly to distal
part of shaft.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Two, from Douglas Co., Kansas, 76834 (2 mi.

<h3>Microtus (Pitymys) parvulus (Howell)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 40</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk broad, greatest length (2.4 mm. in specimen examined)
1&frac34; times greatest breadth, 4 times greatest depth; median process
ossified, size small, less than &frac14; length of stalk, wider than
high, terminally flattened; lateral processes cartilaginous, relatively
small, attenuate; posterior margin in dorsal view flattened, irregularly
curved with concavities medially and laterally; basal tuberosities well

lateral profile a gradual concave slope from point of greatest width
anteriorly to distal part of shaft; tip of shaft enlarged.</p>

<p>The baculum of <i>M. parvulus</i> resembles that of <i>M.

studied, differing primarily in smaller size.</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>: One, from 1 mi. W Micanopy, Alachua Co.,
Florida, Univ. Florida No. 1508.</p>


<h3>Microtus (Pitymys) quasiater (Coues)</h3>
<p class="center">Figs. 29 and 30</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk broad, greatest length (2.6-3.2 mm.)
1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> to 1<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times greatest
breadth, 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> to 3<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times

lateral processes cartilaginous, small, attenuate; posterior profile of
stalk in dorsal view broadly rounded, bilobate, or trilobate, median lobe
formed by posterior projection of dorsal shelf between enlarged lateral
tuberosities that form outer lobes, posterolateral faces of these

slightly concave, ventral concavity broad and deep, median constriction

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg

&frac12; greatest depth; shaft flattened except tip that is more terete,
and bowed dorsally; at mid-point, stalk twice as wide as high; shaft
relatively slender terminally, narrower than median ossification.</p>

<p>The baculum of <i>M. quasiater</i> is the largest and has the best
developed base and median process of the three American species of the
subgenus <i>Pitymys</i>. The three species closely resemble each other in
basic form.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Five, all from Veracruz; Teocelo, 4500 ft.,
30709, 30711; 4 km. N Tlapacoy&aacute;n, 1700 ft., 24466; 5 km. N Jalapa, 4500
ft., 19869, 19878.</p>


<h3>Microtus (Pitymys) fatioi (Mottaz)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 26</p>

<p>The baculum of a single specimen (KU 67103) of <i>M. fatioi</i> from
Zermatt, Valais, Switzerland, was examined. The baculum is immature, as
evidenced by its small size, slender stalk and absence of ossified
processes, therefore no characterization is included.</p>

<p>The baculum of another Old World species of the subgenus
<i>Pitymys</i>, <i>M. pyrenaicus</i> from France, figured and described
by Didier (1954:242-243), differs from all New World <i>Pitymys</i>
examined in processing ossified lateral processes.</p>

<p>The status of <i>Pitymys</i>, as a genus or as a subgenus, is
uncertain. Hall and Cockrum (1953:448) considered the North American
<i>Pitymys</i> and <i>Pedomys</i> as subgenera of <i>Microtus</i>. They
did not state specifically the basis for this point of view, but mention
the fact that these two subgenera (<i>Pitymys</i> and <i>Pedomys</i>)
closely resemble each other cranially. These authors did not study nor
comment upon the status of the Old World <i>Pitymys</i>. It may be asked
whether the Old World and New World <i>Pitymys</i> have developed as
fossorial <i>Microtus</i> independently, or from an ancestor common to
both groups and not common to any other <i>Microtus</i>. Matthey
(1955:202) found 62 chromosomes (2N) in both the New World <i>Pitymys
pinetorum</i> and the Old World <i>Pitymys duodecimcostatus</i>. This
suggests, but does not prove, common ancestry.</p>


<h3>Neofiber alleni True</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 49</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk massive, greatest length (4.7 mm.) 1&frac34; times
greatest breadth, 4 times greatest depth; ossification in digitate
processes variable; in one (KU 27123) of two specimens examined lateral
processes ossified and median process unossified, as in two specimens
examined by Hamilton (1946:379) from "southern Florida"; in my other
specimen (KU 27268) that is possibly more mature, median process ossified
although less deeply stained than lateral ossifications or stalk;
posterior profile in probable dorsal view roughly rounded; in end-view
probable dorsal concavity deep, ventral concavity broad but shallow, and
with center convex; median constriction <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub>
greatest depth; shaft heavy, least depth <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>
greatest depth of base; stalk, at mid-point, slightly wider than deep and
more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> width of base; lateral profile in
dorsal view sharply incurved distal to point of greatest breadth, shaft
therefore relatively distinct from basal part of stalk; slight
subterminal constriction; tip less reduced in the two specimens examined
than in two figured by Hamilton. In preparation, the tissues that make it
possible to distinguish

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg

with certainty the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the baculum were
removed in both specimens.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Two, of the subspecies <i>Neofiber alleni
alleni</i>, 2 mi. S Gainesville, Alachua Co., Florida, 27268; 1 mi. E
Courtenay, Merritt Island, Brevard Co., Florida, 27123.</p>


<h3>Lagurus curtatus (Cope)</h3>
<p class="center">Fig. 46</p>

<p>Baculum: Stalk slender, greatest length (2.5 mm.) 2 to
2<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> times greatest breadth, 4 to 5 times greatest
depth; three ossified processes; median one more than
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> length of stalk, curved dorsally toward tip,
proximally flattened and having acute lateral angles in dorsal view,
wider than deep except in distal half; lateral processes smaller than
median one, slenderer, shorter, of approximately same depth, also curved
dorsally; base of stalk well developed, basal tuberosities medially
confluent, in part visible in dorsal view, in end-view wider ventrally
than dorsally, dorsal and ventral concavities of equal depth and both
wide, medial constriction &frac12; greatest depth; posterior profile in
dorsal view broadly bilobate; lateral profile with abrupt transition from
basal tuberosities to gradually converging, slightly curved sides of
shaft; shaft terminally inflated.</p>

<p>Dearden (1958:543) described and figured the bacula of six subspecies
of <i>Lagurus curtatus</i> and two Asiatic species, <i>Lagurus
lagurus</i> and <i>Lagurus luteus</i>. He examined at least 34 specimens
of <i>L. curtatus</i> and found geographic variation in size, breadth of
shaft distally, and proportions of digital ossifications to each other
and to the stalk. The description that I have given above pertains to
<i>L. c. levidensis</i>.</p>

<p>The baculum of the Asiatic <i>Lagurus (Lagurus) lagurus</i> figured by
Ognev (1950:554) agrees with that of <i>Lagurus (Lemmiscus) curtatus</i>,
described here, in the relatively elongate shaft and slender stalk, the
proportions of the processes, and the well-formed and moderately enlarged
base of the stalk. The bacula of three <i>Lagurus lagurus</i> examined by
Dearden (1958:545) were of older individuals than the specimen that Ognev
figures and differ from it and from bacula of <i>Lagurus curtatus</i>
(all subspecies) in the unusual, almost heart shaped, median process, and
in larger size. <i>Lagurus luteus</i> examined by Dearden (1958:545)
differs from both <i>Lagurus lagurus</i> and <i>Lagurus curtatus</i> in
lacking lateral digital ossifications and in having shorter median
digital ossifications and wider base of stalk.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>: Seven <i>Lagurus curtatus levidensis</i>
from Wyoming; 9 mi. S Robertson, Uinta Co., 26045, 26053; 8 mi. S,

<p style="margin-bottom:2em;">The following key to the bacula in some adult North American
Microtinae is intended to help point out some of the most important
differences. It should be noted that not all species can be keyed out on
the basis of the baculum. The most difficult group in this respect
includes the species of <i>Microtus</i> that have small or no ossified
lateral processes, especially species of the subgenera <i>Pedomys</i> and
<i>Pitymys</i>, and the two species <i>Microtus californicus</i> and
<i>Microtus mexicanus</i> of the subgenus <i>Microtus</i>. Another
complicating factor is the variability of bacula evident in some species
even in the small samples available.

It is to be expected that additional specimens will show variations not
yet observed.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

<p>Owing to shortness of lower incisors and present geographic
distribution of the species, Hinton (1926:35) considered the Tribe Lemmi
(lemmings) to be more primitive than the Tribe Microti (voles). The
surviving lemmings are specialized in many features and therefore are
considered as advanced end-products of an evolutionary radiation of a
primitive microtine stock, of which all earlier stages are extinct.</p>

<p>Hinton regarded <i>Dicrostonyx</i> as the most primitive of the genera
of lemmings on account of its more complex molar teeth (complexity was
considered to be primitive), and on account of the presence of three
primitive longitudinal rows of tubercles in unworn molars. The other
three genera were arranged in order of increasing specialization as
follows: <i>Synaptomys</i>, <i>Myopus</i>, <i>Lemmus</i>.</p>

<p>If the baculum tended to retain its primitive character while
specializations in the external anatomy developed, and if the above
arrangement is correct the most primitive bacula would be found
in <i>Dicrostonyx</i> and in <i>Synaptomys</i>. The baculum in these two
genera in comparison to that in <i>Myopus</i> (as figured by Ognev, 1948:512)

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>

and <i>Lemmus</i> has a slenderer stalk and smaller digital ossifications
or none at all. The baculum in the genera of lemmings increases in
robustness and the development of processes from <i>Dicrostonyx</i>, to
<i>Synaptomys</i>, to <i>Myopus</i>, to <i>Lemmus</i>&mdash;the same
order outlined above for total of specialization. The two extremes in
this series are near the extremes of variation in bacula to be found in
all microtines. The baculum in lemmings as a group cannot then be
considered more primitive than in voles as a group, although the voles
are usually considered to be more advanced. The situation in the voles,
as we shall see, casts a different light on the matter.</p>

<p>The voles, Tribe Microti, were considered by Hinton (1926:40) to be
more advanced than the lemmings because the incisors of the voles are
longer and the root of their last lower molar is lingual to the root of
the incisor. Hinton thought also that the murine ancestors of microtines
had shorter incisors and that the backward extension of the incisors in
the voles is a more ancient feature than the hypsodonty of the molars. A
trend in the molar teeth has been toward greater hypsodonty. The voles in
which the molars are least hypsodont are thus considered primitive. These
include the living genera <i>Clethrionomys</i>, <i>Phenacomys</i>,
<i>Ondatra</i>, <i>Dolomys</i>, <i>Ellobius</i>, and <i>Prometheomys</i>.
Therefore, the baculum, in these assumedly primitive genera, would be
expected to resemble the baculum in the lemmings or at least the most
primitive lemmings. This is not the case.</p>

<p>The bacula that I have examined of <i>Clethrionomys</i> and
<i>Phenacomys</i> have well-developed digital ossifications. In this they
resemble the baculum of the genus <i>Lemmus</i>, the most advanced genus
of lemmings according to Hinton. The baculum of <i>Dolomys</i> has not
been studied. The baculum in <i>Ondatra</i>, and in <i>Prometheomys</i>
as illustrated by Ognev (1948:552), also possesses well-developed
processes. The baculum of <i>Ellobius</i> is small and lacks processes
(as figured by Ognev, 1950:662). No ossification was found in a single
specimen of <i>Ellobius</i> examined by me although the entire glans
penis was removed and cleared without dissection. So far as known then,
with the exception of <i>Ellobius</i> and <i>Phenacomys longicaudus</i>
(Dearden, 1958:547), the primitive microtines having rooted molars
possess bacula having three well-developed ossified processes.</p>

<p>Voles of the genus <i>Microtus</i> vary in the structure of the
baculum almost as much as do the lemmings. Within the single subgenus
<i>Microtus</i> some individuals of <i>Microtus mexicanus</i>, for
example, have minute ossified lateral processes and other individuals
lack these

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>

processes; <i>Microtus pennsylvanicus</i> and some other species have
proportionately large lateral ossifications. If the well-developed
condition of the baculum in the microtines having rooted molars is
primitive, then within the genus <i>Microtus</i> those species having
well-developed bacula may be considered primitive.</p>

<p>The genera <i>Lagurus</i> and <i>Neofiber</i> have moderately
developed or well-developed lateral processes. <i>Neofiber</i> exhibits a
tendency, not prominent elsewhere, to have a proportionately smaller
median process rather than reduced lateral processes.</p>

<p>American species of <i>Microtus</i> (genus and subgenus) that have
moderately- to well-developed ossified lateral processes are <i>M.
townsendii</i>, <i>M. oeconomus</i>, <i>M. pennsylvanicus</i>, <i>M.
montanus</i>, and <i>M. chrotorrhinus</i>. <i>Microtus</i> of other
subgenera having this type of baculum include <i>M. (Herpetomys)
guatemalensis</i>, <i>M. (Chilotus) oregoni</i>, and <i>M. (Chionomys)
longicaudus</i>.</p>

<p>American species of <i>Microtus</i> (genus and subgenus) in which the
lateral ossifications are weakly developed or absent (although
cartilaginous lateral processes are present) include <i>M. mexicanus</i>
and <i>M. californicus</i>. In other subgenera, species of
<i>Microtus</i> having reduced lateral ossifications are <i>M. (Pedomys)
ochrogaster</i>, <i>M. (Pitymys) pinetorum</i>, <i>M. (Pitymys)
parvulus</i>, <i>M. (Pitymys) quasiater</i>, <i>M. (Arvicola)
richardsoni</i>, and <i>M. (Stenocranius) miurus</i>.</p>

<p>The microtines are essentially holarctic in distribution. Both of the
tribes, the lemmings and the voles, as well as primitive representatives
of each tribe (not considering <i>Ellobius</i>) occur in both the Old
World and New World. It is not certain on which continent (or continents)
the Microtinae first differentiated. It is certain, however, that at
various times, both early and late in the evolution of the subfamily,
representatives have crossed from Eurasia to North America or <i>vice
versa</i>. Each of 10 or more microtines in the New World is more closely
related to some microtine in the Old World than to any other microtine in
the New World.</p>

<p>The similarities or differences in the baculum in Old World and New
World representatives placed in the same genus or subgenus, or thought to
be "companion species" have been commented upon in accounts of
<i>Lemmus</i>, <i>Dicrostonyx</i>, <i>Clethrionomys</i>, <i>Lagurus</i>,
<i>Arvicola</i>, <i>Stenocranius</i>, <i>Chilotus</i>, <i>Chionomys</i>,
<i>Pitymys</i>, and in accounts of <i>Microtus agrestis</i> as compared
with <i>M. pennsylvanicus</i>, and <i>Microtus oeconomus</i> (both Old
World and New World).</p>

<p>The baculum in the Microtinae more closely resembles the baculum in
the Cricetinae of the Old World than in the Murinae, or than in any other
rodents known to me. This resemblance suggests relationship between
Microtinae and Cricetinae.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
